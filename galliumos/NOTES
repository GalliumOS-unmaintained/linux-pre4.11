## galliumos/NOTES

This directory borrows some debian organizational rules.

The kernel .gitignore file ignores "debian", "patches", and "series",
so we rename them to "galliumos", "diffs", and "list".

If we edited the kernel .gitignore file instead, we'd risk incomplete
commits if a new version was untarred on top and restored the original
ignore behaviour. So this is awkward, but safe.
